Three observable trends for Heroes of Pymoli:
  1) Males are overwhelmingly the majority of the players and spenders for Heroes of Pymoli.
  2) More than 75% of the Heroes of Pymoli players are between the ages of 15-29, with the bulk of them being 20-24 years old.
  3) The most popular item is also on the more expensive side of optional items that can be purchased. In fact, the top 5 most popular items are on the more expensive side. I wonder what is in these items that entices players to purhase them? Can we add more items like this to the store?
